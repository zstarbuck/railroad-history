        The purpose of this website is to provide a clear and organized history
        of the locomotives that have powered commuter rail services across the
        United States and Canada. This website features a navigation bar where
        visitors can easily explore the evolution of rolling stock from the
        1940s through today. Each section highlights key locomotives, their
        builders, years of production, and the railroads that operated them,
        making it a resource for both rail enthusiasts and people interested in
        how transit technology has changed over time.

        This site also aims to connect technical details with the bigger story
        of commuter rail’s growth in North America. By showcasing locomotives
        decade by decade, users can see how designs shifted to meet new
        demands—whether for efficiency, environmental performance, or passenger
        capacity. The goal is to make this history accessible, visually
        engaging, and informative, offering a central place where anyone can
        learn about the machines that have shaped daily travel for millions of
        riders.

        Clicking on a decade will lead to an assortment of cards, which display
        the locomotives that were produced in that decade. Clicking on a card
        will then display information on that locomotive, including Youtube
        links by content creators explaining the history of these locomotives.
        It is encouraged to check these videos out and share them with your
        circle.

        Lastly, this website aims to provide Metro Atlanta residents with an
        understanding of what commuter and regional rollingstock encompasses.
        GDOT is currently doing several corridor studies for intercity passenger
        rail service and this website can help provide additional perspectve on
        how North American cities have approached developing their passenger
        rail services. I encourage every Georgia resident that is interested in
        this stuff to write to their elected officials in support of GDOT's
        efforts.
