    "1960s":
      "Passenger rail in the US and Canada experienced major decline as automobiles and airlines took market share. The remaining passenger trains were increasingly aged, with older rollingstock still in wide use. Railroads began retiring steam locomotives and dieselization was completed, but little new passenger equipment was invested in. In Canada, CN completed dieselization and experimented with new technologies like the Turbo train late in the decade.", // [web:13][web:14][web:16][web:23][web:28]

    "1970s":
      "The decade saw the creation of Amtrak (1971) in the US and the Rail Passenger Service Act, relieving freight railroads of passenger service responsibilities and consolidating leftover equipment. New purchases like Amtrak's Amfleet cars and double-deck Superliners improved some routes. In Canada, declining passenger use led to government intervention and VIA Rail was formed in 1978, inheriting a patchwork fleet of aged rollingstock. Efforts began to modernize equipment, but finances were tight.", // [web:18][web:19][web:29][web:16][web:30]

    "1980s":
      "Amtrak began to invest in modern passenger cars and rebuilt older equipment, notably expanding use of the Superliner fleet for western trains. Technological improvements were slow and underfunded, but the appearance of European-style cab cars and head-end power helped. VIA Rail in Canada retired troubled Turbo trains and introduced Bombardier LRC sets, continuing to update commuter and corridor fleets.", // [web:21][web:31][web:16][web:30]

    "1990s":
      "Amtrak purchased new rollingstock for faster, more comfortable service, notable for introducing the GE Genesis locomotives and expanding usage of refurbished Amfleet cars. Commuter rail renaissance began in many US cities, with new bi-level and single-level cars and some new lines. In Canada, VIA Rail continued updating its fleet with newer cars and locomotives for intercity and corridor service.", // [web:21][web:16]

    "2000s":
      "Passenger rail in North America saw renewed federal investment. Amtrak received updated rollingstock, new locomotive orders, and both US and Canadian commuter rail agencies purchased modern push-pull sets and improved accessibility. VIA Rail replaced aging LRC and Heritage cars with newer equipment, and American commuter operators like Caltrain and Metrolink expanded their fleets.", // [web:21][web:16]

Amtrak expanded and refreshed corridor fleets. Canadian and US operators adopted more modern cars for regional and urban transit, enhancing accessibility, reliability, and passenger comfort.", // [web:21][web:16]

Battery, hybrid, and fully electric rollingstock are entering service for urban and commuter agencies. Both Amtrak and VIA Rail have ordered state-of-the-art equipment to replace last-century cars, focusing on speed, comfort, and sustainability.", // [web:21]
